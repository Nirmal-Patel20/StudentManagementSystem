# 🎓 Student Management System (C++)

A simple console-based Student Management System built in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and file handling. It allows adding, saving, loading, and removing student data using persistent storage (text files). Designed for practicing class structure, file I/O, and STL containers.
